# SimpleFlask

SimpleFlask is a lightweight Flask-based web server designed to log and monitor server activities. It provides RESTful APIs for recording and retrieving activity logs, and includes a Monitor module powered by a background service that continuously analyzes server behavior, updates monitoring data in real time, and handles monitoring-related API requests.

The Monitor runs as a separate service that calculates metrics like request rates and error frequencies, maintains the monitor database, and proactively raises alerts for abnormal patterns.
